**Stefania F. Cardenas**
====================
I'm a junior level Software Developer passionate about making beautiful functional web applications. After graduating with a first class degree in Oriental Languages from La Sapienza University, I spent 18 months working as a recruitment consultant in the IT sector. I decided to join a highly intensive web development course to pursue my life-long interest for web technologies and kickstart a career as a junior web developer.
I am eager to continue developing my skills while working in a creative environment. [Read my code] on Github.
